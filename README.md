# DraftArtistV2
This project is a extension of the work done in https://github.com/czxttkl/DraftArtist, if documentation is needed for some code, we haven't explained it will be explained in that project.

It extends the previous code by adding player data in the recommendation algorithm. Using a players winrate, to determine what hero should be recommended for the player.
